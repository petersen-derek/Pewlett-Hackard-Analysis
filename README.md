Based on the images above:
- There are over 28,000 staff retiring for each of the Senior positions(Staff & Engineer)
- There are over 500 mentors available for the Senior Staff and Senior Engineer
- There are between 150 to 200 mentors available for the Engineer and Staff position
- Neither of the two retiring Managers are eligible to be mentors.

## Summary

- Based on the analysis completed there will be just over 90K roles to be filled - 90,398.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

- Depending on the desired ratio of mentors to mentees - there is likely not enough mentors.  As you can see in the image above, approximately 1.7% of eligible retirees are eligible for the mentorship meaning if all retirees are replaced, then there would be 50 mentees per mentor.
